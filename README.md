# Printd

Allow participants to request prints right from within Toph. Process print jobs locally using Printd.

![](overview.png)

You will have to download Printd and run it on a local computer connected to a printer.

If the computer with the printer has Linux on it, you will need to ensure that CUPS is installed and the printer is configured correctly.

You will also need a [configuration file](#configuration) for Printd. This configuration file is contest-specific. You can download this configuration file from Toph once the printing feature is enabled for your contest.

## Dependencies

Linux:

- CUPS: Printd uses `lpr` to dispatch the print job to the printer.

## Usage

```
Â» ./printd -h
Usage of ./printd:
  -config string
    	path to configuration file (default "printd-config.toml")
```
